    "\n",
    "Counter-Strike 2 (CS2) is a first-person shooter esports game made by Valve Corporation. The game is divided into many rounds, where teams play either the Terrorists (T) who try to plant a bomb on a specific parts of the map (\"bombsites\"), and the Counter-Terrorists (CT) who try to defuse the bomb or kill the terrorists.\n",

    "Teams play 12 rounds on each side (sometimes called \"regulation time\"), and the first team to get 13 rounds won, wins the game. If both teams reach 12 rounds won, then the game goes into \"overtime\" (OT), and additional 3 rounds are added to each side, meaning a team wins in overtime if 4 rounds are won. If both teams win 3 rounds in overtime, the game goes into another overtime infinitely until a team wins 4 times in overtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the start of team round, all players get a specific amount of money that can be used to buy various guns and grenades.\n",
    "\n",
    "The grenades, also known as utilities, can be used by players to get information, or for taking control over parts of the map.\n",

    "The game has developed a competitive esports scene over both it and its prequel, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive's lifetime. Valve Corporation, as well as other entities such as ESL (Electronic Sports League), PGL and Blast, maintain several tourament circuits around the world. We wanted to analyze different factors about how professional CS2 players play. To do this, we are analyzing games played from a single CS2 tournament, and chose ESL's IEM Dallas 2025 due to its recency at the time of writing and its prestige within the Counter-Strike community.\n",

    "## Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Our data is contains information about the games played during IEM Dallas 2025. It is split across four CSV files: `demos.csv`, `players.csv`, `teams.csv` and `matches.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`demos.csv` contains the bulk of our data, and contains specifically data about how the players played for each map (game) of the tournament.\n",
    "\n",
    "`players.csv` contains information about the players at the tournament, including some data about their career.\n",
    "\n",
    "`teams.csv` contains information about the team standings at the tournament.\n",
    "\n",
    "`matches.csv` contains a list of matches and games that were played at the tournament, along with their HLTV links.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our data gathering, we downloaded replay (demo) files for all games played during IEM Dallas 2025 from HLTV.org, a website that is considered to be the most comprehensive database of Counter-Strike esports data. The files we downloaded ended up being 71 games total. In order to parse these replay files, we used a library called [`demoparser2`](https://github.com/LaihoE/demoparser). This library allows us to read demo files and parse information such as game events, game ticks, and player information.\n",
    "\n",
    "We created a script called `read_demo.py` that takes in a demo file and creates a CSV file with various statistics for each round and player. We then combine these CSV files with another script called `join_csv.py`. While testing the script, we realized that some games were split into multiple demo files, which were harder to parse, and in the end, we decided to drop these games as these were only 3 out of our entire set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another issue we encountered was that our initial `read_demo.py` script incorrectly parsed the side (T or CT) that a team was on, so we had to make a second `get_round_sides.py` script that we used to generate a CSV that was then used to patch the original CSV file we generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the main CSV file, we also manually scraped `matches.csv` and `players.csv` files to augment the information for our analysis. The data for both of these files come from HLTV.org's public data about players and tournaments, and were manually copied into Google Sheets before exporting as CSV.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the following implications should be noted:\n",
    "- Some games were dropped due to difficulties in parsing data from split demo files.\n",
    "- For player inventories, there are times that the player only had their knife, and no guns at the tick the inventory check was done. Checking the demo file in game showed that the player had dropped their gun at this time.\n",
